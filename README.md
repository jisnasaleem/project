# projectsign board classification system

It is machine learning project. The aim of this project is to build a model for identifying the road sign board and recognise it and give alert to the vehicle driver.
I have trained the model using CNN algorithm .
I used python 3.7.8 version and Jupyter notebook .
The system is trained using a German traffic dataset from kaggle. It contain test(test.csv) and training data (train.csv).It have 43 different classes.
I have also created a GUI
